# Biscates.
Biscates. It's the platorm to help you find people who'll do that odd job for you.

Focused on the community, trust and reputation, you'll find help for any "biscate" you need to see done - whether it's construction work or someone to sew that old shirt.

## Setup
Create your python virtual environment (changing ```env``` to your preferred virtual environment name), and install the required dependencies:
```
python -m venv env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you're using [autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv), change the variable ```venv``` in the ```.env``` script to your virtual environment name (or use ```env``` as we do).

Also, use Python 3. If you're still using Python 2 in 2018, rethink your life choices.
