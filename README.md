Hi.

## Setup
Create your python virtual environment (changing ```env``` to your preferred virtual environment name), and install the required dependencies:
```
python -m venv env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you're using [autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv), change the variable ```venv``` in the ```.env``` script to your virtual environment name (or use ```env``` as we do).
